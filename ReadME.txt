 A DAT Tool for the Playstation Vita. Currently only index.dat files are supported.
 It can encrypt or decrypt a dat file. Keys need to be in 'C:\vitakeys\'. For index
  and the encryption part: the tool will compute a SHA256 Hash of the index.txt and 
 will copy it on top of the index.txt in RAM, then encrypt it. Not much more to say
  right now beside that there is no public way to copy that new encrypted index.dat
  back to your Vita. If something will be released and your a User please be carefull.
 If you are a dev and can tell me something about DAT's for Vita i would be glad to
  learn something new :)
  
  * Special Greets and THX to Hykem & Proxima for sharing the keys with us.
